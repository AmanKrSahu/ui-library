## What is UI Library?

UI Library is a comprehensive UI toolkit built as an extension to shadcn/ui, offering advanced components that combine elegant design with practical functionality. It delivers production-grade elements such as interactive data grids, intelligent file upload zones, and responsive AI chat modules—empowering developers to build sophisticated interfaces without starting from scratch.

## Built on shadcn/ui

While shadcn/ui establishes a strong foundation with its minimalist, style-agnostic components, UI Library expands this ecosystem with richer, feature-complete solutions. It integrates deeply with shadcn’s theming and utility-first approach while introducing advanced composites—like dynamic date range selectors, collaborative rich-text editors, and intuitive drag-and-drop surfaces—that simplify complex frontend tasks.

## Open Source

As an MIT-licensed project, UI Library thrives on transparency and community input. Every component is open to inspection, modification, and improvement. We invite developers worldwide to contribute, whether by refining documentation, submitting issues, or proposing new features. Together, we’re shaping a more efficient and inclusive future for UI development.
